# Mid-Lane-Guide
The very first website I made on my own, from scratch. This was the final project in my Website Authorization 2 course.

This repository contains the files for the first website I ever made completely from scratch. This website was built for a final project in my Website Authorization 2 course. I have always enjoyed the game, League of Legends, and I thought it would be a perfect fit for this project. In the game I've always played mid-lane, so I made this guide to help other players learn how to play the game. Be careful...this guide is horribly out dated.

mid-lane-guide folder contains all the files for the website. You can view the site by looking at index.html
