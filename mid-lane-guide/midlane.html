		<h3>Why Is Mid-Lane So Important</h3>
		
		<p>The middle lane is the most important lane in League of Legends. It is so 
		important because it is the shortest lane between the two nexuses.If you can
		secure mid-lane for your team, you are securing a direct route into
		the enemy base, as well as a prominent lane for ganking.</p>
		
		<!--Summoner's Rift Image-->
		<a href="images/Summoners-Rift.jpg"><img class="padimage" src="images/Summoners-Rift.jpg" height="420" width="550" alt="Summoner's Rift"></a>
		
		<p>As you can see, the middle lane gives you better access to the enemy's jungle,
		as well as the ability to counteract to enemies invading on your jungle. The key
		to this game is positioning, and by having a secure hold on mid-lane you are in a
		better command of how quickly your team can assume their battle positions. You can 
		also dictate control over the global objectives of the Dragon and Baron pits. Maintaining 
		control over the middle lane will provide your team with many benefits, and will increase
		your overall chance of victory.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>The Golden Rule</h3>
		
		<p>One of the most helpful things you can learn to greatly improve your performance, is
		to always be aware of the map. Map awareness is what makes or breaks any given lane, with
		the middle lane being the most difficult to be fully aware of. If you are playing mid-lane, 
		you need to be aware of potential ganks from both sides of the river, as well as the ganks 
		from above or below the river ramps. This brings us to the most important item of the game:</p>
		
		<p><b>Sight Wards!</b></p>
		<a href="images/Sight_Ward_item.png"><img class="floatleft" src="images/Sight_Ward_item.png" height="65" width="65" alt="Sight Wards"></a>
		<ul>
			<li>Cost 75g</li>
			<li>Provides 3 minute of vision in a location</li>
			<li>Guaranteed to save lives</li>
			<li>Buy one every time you return to base</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>This item will give you vision of a location on the map for a full three minutes. This 
		will protect you from ganks, let you know when you can push a lane, allows you to alert your
		team about enemy roamers and can even spot global ultimates heading to your teammates. The 
		benefits this item bestows is just too valuable to a team, and you would be silly not to take
		advantage of them. If you return to base, and have at least 75g left after you have finished 
		making your purchases, then you need to buy a ward.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Why Should I play Mid-Lane?</h3>
		
		<p>Now you may be saying to yourself, "Why should I play the mid-lane? It seems like it's
		too much work and entirely too stressful." Well you're partly right. The mid-lane is a lot of 
		work, but with proper preparation and practice you'll be able to secure it for your team and march
		right up to the enemy nexus. You should play this lane if you want to be a hero to your team, and 
		and a bane to the enemy. You should play this lane, if you want to help your team secure objectives
		and disrupt the enemy jungle. As previously stated the shortest route to the enemy base is right
		up the middle lane, and the team who secures it generally tends to win more games.</p>
		
		<p>So if you're ready, the <a href="begcharacters.html">characters</a> page has a list of easy to complex
		difficulty characters to play, to start getting you some experience in the middle lane.</p>
