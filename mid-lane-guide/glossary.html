	<h3>Important Terms</h3>
	
	<p><b><u>Health</u></b> This is a measurement of your overall health score. If this number reaches 0, you are dead =( </p>

	<p><b><u>Mana</u></b> This is the resource which fuels most of your special abilities. Skills generally have a mana cost associated with them, and
	as you use the skills the cost is deducted from your mana pool. If you do not have sufficient mana to pay the cost, you will not be able to use the 
	skill.</p>

	<p><b><u>Attack Damage (AD)</u></b> This is a measurement of your physical strength. The higher this number, the more damage your auto-attacks and physical
	skills will do.</p>

	<p><b><u>Auto-Attacks</u></b> Auto-attacks are the standard attacks you make against targets. These attacks are not skills or abilities, and are made
	by simply right-clicking on the target.</p>

	<p><b><u>Ability Power (AP)</u></b> This is a measurement of your magical ability. The higher this number, the stronger your abilities and skills
	that deal magical damage will do.</p>

	<p><b><u>Movement Speed</u></b> This is a numerical measurement of how fast your champion moves across the fields.</p>

	<p><b><u>Armor</u></b> This is a measurement of how well your character resists physical damage. The higher this number, the less physical damage your
	character will receive. Armor is a direct counter to Attack Damage.</p>

	<p><b><u>Magic Resist</u></b> This is a measurement of how well your character resists magical damage. The higher this number, the less magical damage
	your character will receive. Magic Resist is a direct counter to Ability Power.</p>

	<p><b><u>Armor/Magic Penetration</u></b> Armor and Magic Penetration will lower the enemy champions Armor and Magic Resist respectively, by a certain amount.</p>

	<p><b><u>Mana/Heath Regen</u></b> This is a measurement of how much health/mana your character regenerates their health and mana pools respectively.</p> 
	
	<p><b><u>Cooldown Reduction</u></b> This number lowers how long it takes for your skills to come off of cooldown, so that they can be used again. This number
	caps at 40%, at which point you cannot get anymore cooldown reduction.</p>

	<p><b><u>Minions</u></b> These are the monsters that inhabit the lanes, and try to push alongside champions. They are killed, or farmed, for money and gold
	so that you can gain experience and items. You'll spend a good portion of the early game farming the enemy minions, so that you can build up and prepare for
	the late game. Minions begin spawning at one minute and thirty seconds into the game.</p>

	<p><b><u>Last Hitting</u></b> This is a term used to define the action of hitting a minion when it has low health, so that you destroy the minion and collect
	the gold. This is an important skill to master, as it directly effects how quickly you get items in the game.</p>

	<p><b><u>Bush/Brush</u></b> This refers to the tall grass or brush you see on the map. It blocks visibility, preventing you from seeing inside if you're not in
	the brush yourself. Very important to stay in here when you are trying to gank, and go when the enemy is out of position.</p>	

	<p><b><u>Farming</u></b> Farming is just the term used to describe the action of repeatedly slaying the minion creatures in order to gain gold and experience.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Dragon</u></b> The Dragon is a neutral minion, who when killed gives that team a huge team gold bonus.</p>

	<p><b><u>Baron</u></b> The Baron is a neutral minion, who when killed gives that team a huge team gold bonus, as well as a buff that increases all of their stats.</p>

	<p><b><u>Turrets</u></b> These are objectives in the lanes that need to be destroyed in order to push the enemy's base. There are three turrets in each lane, with an additional
	two turrets protecting the nexus. In order to win, your team will have to destroy a total of at least 5 turrets, before they can march down a lane and into the enemy nexus.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Inhibitors</u></b> The inhibitors are objectives, that when destroyed, give your minions the chance to spawn "Super" minions. These minions are tougher to kill, and 
	take much less damage from turrets, giving them the ability to push a lane when you are not present. The inhibitors are placed after the third turret in a lane, right before
	the nexus turrets.</p>

	<p><b><u>Jungle</u></b> The jungle refers to the spaces on the map that are in between the lanes. The jungle houses the neutral monster camps and provides a place to prepare for 
	ganks.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Area of Effect (AoE)</u></b> Area of Effect skills are skills that target an area and hit multiple people.</p>

	<p><b><u>Crowd Control (CC)</u></b> This is any skill or ability that hampers the movement of a champion. Examples are slows, stuns, taunts, and snares. If it prevents a champion
	from moving or reaching an objective, it's a form of crowd control.</p>	

	<p><b><u>Buff/Debuff</u></b> Buffs and Debuffs or either positive or negative effects bestowed upon friendly or enemy champions respectively. If you give a friendly player increased 
	attack damage, you've given them a buff. If you give an enemy player reduced attack damage, you've given them a debuff.</p>
