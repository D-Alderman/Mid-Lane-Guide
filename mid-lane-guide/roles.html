	<h3>The Champions</h3>
	
	<p>Champion roles define the basic playstyle of a champions. The 6 roles are: Assassin, Fighter, Mage, Marksman, Support, and Tank.
	In this section I'll define each role and explain which lane they are most often played in.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Assassin:</u></b> These are champions with a relatively low health pool, low defenses but have enhanced movement speed or
	stealthed movements. They are capable of pumping out a very high amount of damage in a very short amount of time. They usually
	are able to find an enemy alone or out of position, key in on them, and burst down or "assassinate" them before the enemy can
	react.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Fighter:</u></b> These are champions who have a moderate amount of health, a moderate amount of defenses, and usually
	average or above average melee damage. These are the champions follow into a fight behind the tank and are made to force their way
	through the enemy lines in order to get to their key damage dealers. They usually have skills that allow them to enhance their 
	survivability in order to make it to that point.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Mage:</u></b> These are champions who focus solely on dealing magic damage. They have low to moderate health values, 
	usually lower defenses, and tend to move slowly. That's balanced out by a longer attack range, and the ability to deal high damage 
	without having to get in close to a fight. Most of the mid-lane champions fall into this category, so most of the guide will follow
	up on the playstyles of easy to learn mid-lane champions.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Marksman:</u></b> These are champions who, as their name suggests, attack at long range using physical damage attackes. 
	They have lower health and defenses than the average champion, but they provide a good source of damage. They typically have skills 
	that increase their damage dealing abilities by either increasing their attack speed, range, or adding AoE to their moves. These 
	champions provide a constant source of sustained damage to their team, due to them not being cooldown or ability dependant. Most of 
	their damage comes from auto-attacks.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Support:</u></b> These are champions who have abilities that buff their teammates, or put debuffs on the enemy champions.
	They fall into several subcategories with the two most popular being tanky-supports and pure supports. Tanky supports generally have
	higher health and defenses then most supports, while pure supports have lower health but greater overall team bonuses. These characters
	usually do not fare well in one-on-one combat, but provide a team wide bonus to most combat abilities provided that they are nearby.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Tank:</u></b> These champions usually have very high health, very high defenses, and very high survivability. This comes
	at a cost to damage output and mobility usually. These champions are meant to go headfirst into a battle and disrupt the enemy team as
	much as possible while your teammates pick up the enemies who are out of position. They usually have abilities that interrupt enemy players
	and enhance their own survivability.</p>

	<p>One special thing to note about all champions is that they each have 5 abilities: 1 passive ability and 4 active abilities. The passive ability
	is usually something related to the theme of the champion, such as increasing an important stat or giving you the ability to burn your enemies over
	time when you hit them with a skill. Passive abilities, as the name suggests, are always in play and you do not need to activate them. As you play
	the game, your champion will level up once it accumulates enough experience. When that happens, you'll get a skill point to allocate in one
	of your active abilities. The active abilities are assigned to the Q, W, E and R keys, with the R key being the character's ultimate ability. 
	Unlike the other abilities, you can only assign skill points in your ultimate at levels 6, 11, and 16.</p>
	
	<p>Now that you know about the champions, it's time to get into the lane assignments. If you're reading this guide, then 
	you're more than likely thinking about playing the mid-lane. Which means that you're more than likely going to play a mage type champion. 
	Since League of Legends is a team game, it's helpful to learn about the roles of the individuals in their respective lanes. By understanding
	your team's playstyle, you'll better learn how you can help boost your team to victory.</p>  

	<h3>Lane Assignments</h3>
	
	<p><b><u>Top:</u></b> This lane is usually given to the team's tank or fighter character. The ideal behind the theory is to have them in
	a one-on-one lane where they can spend time farming the minions and building items, to better help their team in the teamfighting phase of the
	game.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Jungler:</u></b> The jungle is usually given to the team's tank or fighter champion, who ever is not going in the top lane. The 
	jungle is full of unaligned, or neutral minions, who provide champions with buffs and gold when they are beaten. The main job of the jungler
	is to clear the jungle minions and assist, or gank, his team's lanes at opportune times. The importance of having a jungler, is that it gives 
	your team essentially three solo lanes, so that the champions in those lanes can get experience and farm for gold without worry. If you notice, 
	your team is composed of 5 players, but there are only three lanes. By having a jungler on your team, you are leaving your top lane without a 
	laning partner, but he will make up for it by getting a huge experience and level lead over his opponents if they do not have a jungler.</p> 
		
	<p><b><u>Mid:</u></b> This is your role right here. You are responsible for defending the shortest lane from your base to the enemy base.
	Mostly mage type champions play this lane, although there have been some instances where assassins cover the mid lane as well. 
	
	<p><b><u>Carry:</u></b> Usually a marksman type champions play this role. The carry is generally weak in the early phases of the game, but 
	once they gain levels and items, they become a powerhouse and can help "carry" your team to victory. The carry is generally in the bottom lane
	with a support character.</p>
	
	<p><b><u>Support:</u></b> Support characters usually play this role, and their main goal is to assist the carry in getting farmed and leveled. 
	They can protect the carry and harass the enemy team using various poking skills. They usually accompany the carry in the bottom lane.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h3>Gameplay Mechanics</h3> 
	
	<p>OK! Now that we've learned about the champion roles and lane assignments, it's time to get into the meat of the guide. You need to learn
	how to play League of Legends. In this section I will be going over the basic mechanics of the game, including the main objective and how you
	are supposed to work with your team to accomplish the goal. Don't worry if some of the terms used do not make sense at the moment, as there is a
	glossary of important terms in the section immediately following this one.</p>

	<p>The gameplay of League of Legends can be broken down across three phases: Early Game, Mid Game, and Late Game. I'll go through each phase of the
	game and tell you what your role is as a mid lane player.</p>


	<p><b>Early Game:</b> The early game usually lasts from minion spawning until about 10-15 minutes, or when the first turret is destroyed. During this
	phase of the game your job will be to farm, farm, farm! You'll need to play smart and focus purely on last hitting enemy minions in order to gain gold
	and experience. Be wary of ganks from both sides of the river, and don't go for the kill on an enemy unless an opportunity presents itself. Only go for 
	a kill if you catch the enemy out of position and have your skills and abilities ready to go. Push the enemy turret when you have the opportunity to do 
	so, but always be mindful of your flank and the enemy's ability to gank you. In summary, make sure you kill minions, go back to base and buy bigger and 
	stronger items when you can afford them.</p>

	<p><b>Mid Game:</b> This is the point of the game after the first turret is destroyed, usually around the 15-25 minute mark. At this point in the game
	teamfights start to break out, making roaming a bit more dangerous. The Dragon becomes a sought after prize, as the gold bonus goes a long way to providing
	vital items. At this point you will want to be extremely careful of ganks involving the enemy jungler and other champions in tandem. As long as your lane is 	
	pushed to the enemy turret, feel free to roam yourself and gank the other lanes. If you do, just make sure that you know where the enemy teams champions are,
	lest you want a nasty surprise waiting for you in the jungle brush. That's one of the great things about the mid lane, you're close to everything. Just continue
	to play smart and victory will soon be yours.</p>

	<p><b>Late Game:</b> This point of the game is usually around the 30 minute  mark, when players start to complete their second or third major item. At this point
	in the game, you do not want to travel alone. Teamfights are standard, and you will rarely encounter an enemy roaming alone. Make certain that you have your escape
	abilities and cooldowns ready, in case you find yourself in a tight spot. Continue to assist your teammates in any way that you can, and help secure the win!</p>

	<p>Well now that you've got the general flow of the game down, it's time to get in there and get some practice matches. But before you do that, you may want to 
	check on some recommended <a href="begcharacters.html">Champions</a> for newer players.</p>
