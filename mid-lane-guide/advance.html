	<p>Well now that you've gotten a good look at the characters and how the game is played you, you're probably looking for some of the 
	more advanced pointers, to really push your gameplay to the upper tier of players. Get the edge on the competition using these advanced
	tips: </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Always buy wards!!</li>
		<li>In the early game, your main priority is to FARM! You need to make sure you have more minion kills than your opponent, so getting
		those minion kills should always be your number one goal. Only go for a kill on the enemy if you're certain you can do it, specifically
		if they are caught out of position.</li>
		<li>If you push your lane to the enemy turret, don't be afraid to roam to the other lanes. Especially true if you know the enemy
		jungler is in another lane.</li>
		<li>You don't have to stick on one item build from start to finish. The items listed for the characters are a good starting point, 
		but the good players know how to build on the fly. You need to learn to adapt to each game, and build accordingly. Up against a high
		Attack Damage character? Build an early <img src="images/Zhonya's_Hourglass_item.png" height="30" width="30">Zhonya's Hourglass to get some bonus armor and 
		AP at the same time!</li>
		<li>You spotted the enemy jungler in another lane (probably due to a ward you placed earlier ^_-)! GO ahead and push your lane hard,
		since you know he won't be able to come up behind you and gank. Better yet, if your lane is already pushed, go roam to the opposite lane where the
		enemy jungler is, and help gank that lane.</li>
		<li>Pay attention to the minimap! I cannot overestimate the importance of map awareness.</li>
		<li>Buy more wards!</li>
		<li>Getting beat in lane? Or do you want to push an early advantage you have? Buy another <img src="images/Doran's_Ring_item.png" height="30" width="30"> Doran's
		Ring. In the early game phase, the Doran's items are extremely gold efficient.</li>
		<li>Want to stay in lane forever? Start with a <img src="images/Crystalline_Flask_item.png" height="30" width="30"> Crystalline Flask, which functions
		as a health potion and mana potion at the same time, and some extra health potions. This starting item combo will give you a high amount of sustain, but 
		no offensive bonuses to your abilities. Start with this, farm safely and you won't need to go back to base for a looonnnng time!</li>
		<li>If you successfully destroy your enemy's outer turret, use the pushed wave to steal some of the opposing enemy's jungle minions. Head to the enemy jungle
		and steal a few easy minions. Be wary of the jungler though, if you see him, it's probably safest to back out.</li>
		<li>Play Morgana, win game</li>
		<li>Use the brush to your advantage. Enemies cannot target you specifically if they cannot see you.</li>
		<li>Being chased in the jungle? Use the jungle brush to duck in and out in order to confuse and lose your pursuers in the undergrowth.</li>
		<li>Buy one more ward for good measure</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>And that's the end folks. I hope you enjoyed reading this guide as much as I enjoyed making it. I hope you found some good information, and are able to incorporate
	it into your gameplay. While these tips will help you if you're struggling, there is no substitute for genuine experience. The best way to improve on your
	performance, is to practice practice practice. Hopefully one day I'll see you, on the Summoner's Rift.</p>
